# Jekyll-Breadcrumb-Microdata

A [BreadcrumbList](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList) is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.

## Usage

Copy `index.html` in your `_includes` folder (rename it as you want, i.e. `breadrcrumbs.html`). 

Style it with your own CSS or use my style, see: `<!-- comments -->`.

*If you don't know how **includes** work, go to [Jekyll includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) on Jekyll official website.*
